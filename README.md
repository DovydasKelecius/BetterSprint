# BetterMovement

BetterMovement is a lightweight client-side mod for Hytale that enhances player movement by improving sprinting behavior and overall movement responsiveness. The goal of this mod is to make movement feel smoother, more natural, and less restrictive compared to the vanilla experience without altering core gameplay balance.

This mod is ideal for players who want a more fluid movement system while keeping the game close to its intended design.
